# Nutkin

Get a grip on navigation state.

Intertwining navigation and business logic with your presentation layer
causes unclear responsibilities as well as hard to test states. Nutkin
separates the two by introducing composable modular navigation to which
the view layer can subscribe and react.

**Nutkin's API's haven't stabilized yet and may break until 1.0**

## Credits

Nutkin is based on the brilliant concepts posed by [nhaarman](https://github.com/nhaarman) in
his carefully designed library [Acorn](https://github.com/nhaarman/Acorn) and is in no
way original work. However Nutkin targets to provide a set of implementations
to work on the web.
